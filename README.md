  This web-based to-do list project is designed to help users manage their daily tasks easily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
  JavaScript is used to directly manipulate the elements on the webpage, such as displaying the task list, marking tasks as completed, or removing them. 
  The application also uses the browser's local storage (localStorage) to keep task data saved even after the page is reloaded. With this feature, users can enjoy a simple, fast, and practical 
  experience without the need for additional servers.
